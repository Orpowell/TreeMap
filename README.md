# TreeMap
Tree Map is a simple tool that shows the positions of previously identified trees as a coloured dots on a map using GPS coordinates. The colour of the dot is determined by the score assigned to a given tree ranging from 0 to 10. This can be used to display an inforamtion that may be useful to visualise.

TreeMap has three dependencies: Python (v3.10) and two libraries pandas and plotly (see requirements.txt).
